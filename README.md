# @technobuddha/library

## Introduction

This is a large library of many functions that the [Technobuddha](https://technobuddha.com) has found useful over the years. In one form or another this library has been around since the later part of the 20th century. This is the latest (as of 2021) incarnation of the library, this time ported to Typescript.

The technobuddha library is designed to keep your bundled software as small as possible. Each function is in it's own module and must be imported separately.

## Documentation

## Installation

Using npm:

```shell
npm install @technobuddha/library
```

The technobuddha library is released under the [MIT license](LICENSE).

## Usage

With ES6 import:

```typescript
import name from '@technobuddha/library/name';

// for example

import plural from '@technobuddha/library/plural';
```

With require:

```javascript
const name = require('@technobuddha/library/name').name;

// for example

const plural = require('@technobuddha/library/plural').plural;
```

When imported from Typescript, the original typescript version of each module is used. This can be then transpiled in to whichever language version you wish (ES5, ES6, ESNEXT, etc.).

When imported from Javascript, a transpiled (into ES5) version is used.
